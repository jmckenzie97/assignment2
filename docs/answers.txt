H.
Inheritance: Basing a class off of another class i.e a fishing boat is a child of a boat
Polymorphism: Objects of different types can be accessed through the same interface
Encapsulation: Bundling data and the functions that act upon that data into one unit i.e. an object/class

I.
The main difference is that in Dictator-Lieutenant, all the developers work are integrated together by the Lieutenants and then the Dictator integrates that work into the main project
while in Integration manager the developers post their work on their public repo and the integration manager is in charge of integrating the developers public repo into the main

J.
Having the Lieutenants there to proofread the work before it is committed to the repo would probably solve a lot of merge conflicts, especially with such a large dev team
